# Project Statement

## 1. Problem Statement
With the increasing threat of climate change and carbon rising , transportation contributes significantly to global carbon emissions. However, many daily drivers lack an accessible, immediate tool to find the environmental impact of their specific vehicle trips. This lack of awareness creates the non eco friendly driving habits and prevents individuals from making informed decisions about their carbon emission during travel.

## 2. Scope of the Project
The idea of this project is to develop a user friendly, Python based tool that reduces the gap between daily travel and environmental data. The system:
- takes user inputs regarding vehicle travel parameters such as fuel type, distance, mileage.
- calculates the emmision using formulas for emission.
-  Gives outputs of the total Carbon emissions in kilograms.
- gives immediate "Eco-Feedback" to state the trip as safe,polluting environment, or use public transport.

## 3. Target Users
- *Daily travellers:* Individuals wishing to track and reduce their personal carbon emission.
- *Eco-conscious Drivers:* Individuals looking to optimize their travel efficiency.
- *Students & Educators:* For demonstrating environmental impact calculations in academics.
- *Logistics Managers:* Small-scale travelling business owners wanting a quick estimate of trip emissions.

## 4. High-Level Features
- *Modular Data Input:* handles very well the user inputs for fuel type and numerical travel data.
- *Calculation Engine:* accurate mathematical computation of carbon based on recognized emission coefficients.
- *Eco-Feedback System:* A conditional logic module that categorizes emissions and suggests eco-friendly actions (e.g., "Consider Public Transport").
- *Error Handling & Validation:* A defensive programming layer that prevents system crashes due to incorrect user input types.
