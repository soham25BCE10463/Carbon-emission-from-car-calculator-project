# Project Statement

## 1. Problem Statement
With the increasing threat of climate change, transportation contributes significantly to global carbon emissions. However, many daily drivers and fleet managers lack an accessible, immediate tool to quantify the environmental impact of their specific vehicle trips. This lack of awareness hinders the adoption of eco-friendly driving habits and prevents individuals from making informed decisions about their travel footprints.

## 2. Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is to develop a user-friendly, Python-based tool that bridges the gap between daily travel and environmental data. The system:
- Accepts user inputs regarding vehicle travel parameters (fuel type, distance, mileage).
- Processes these inputs using standard scientific emission factors (stoichiometry).
- Outputs the total Carbon emissions in kilograms.
- Provides immediate "Eco-Feedback" to classify the trip as safe,polluting environment, or use public transport.

## 3. Target Users
- *Daily Commuters:* Individuals wishing to track and reduce their personal carbon footprint.
- *Eco-conscious Drivers:* Users looking to optimize their travel efficiency.
- *Students & Educators:* For demonstrating environmental impact calculations in academic settings.
- *Logistics Managers:* Small-scale fleet owners wanting a quick estimate of trip emissions.

## 4. High-Level Features
- *Modular Data Input:* Robust handling of user inputs for fuel type and numerical travel data.
- *Calculation Engine:* Precise mathematical computation of CO2 based on recognized emission coefficients.
- *Eco-Feedback System:* A conditional logic module that categorizes emissions and suggests eco-friendly actions (e.g., "Consider Public Transport").
- *Error Handling & Validation:* A defensive programming layer that prevents system crashes due to incorrect user input types.
